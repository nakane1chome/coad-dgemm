DGEMM examples derived from Computer Organization and design : The hardware/software interface

Simple profiling code added to count CPU clocks on ARM Cortex-A or x86_64.

Vector code has been made generic for either RM Cortex-A or x86_64.

Two implementations done:

- Unoptimized.
- Cache blocking.
